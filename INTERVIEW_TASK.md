# ðŸ“¸ Interview Task: Electron.js App with Instagram Scraping

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Embark on the journey to develop a **kaleidoscopic** Electron.js application that:

1. Embeds **Instagram** inside the app.
2. Scrapes your profile data from Instagram (e.g. posts, comments, likes).
3. Displays the scraped data in a **second tab**, placed beside the embedded Instagram page.
4. Uses a **React-based approach** for the frontend UI.

This task beckons developers to delve into a **mosaic** of frontend and backend orchestration where data flows like a verdant river across elegantly crafted tabs.

---

## ðŸ§© Requirements

- Use **Electron.js** to create the application.
- Load **Instagram** directly inside the application window.
- Implement **web scraping** to dynamically extract profile data such as:
  - Posts
  - Comments
  - Likes
- Display the scraped data in a **second tab**, adjacent to the Instagram view.
- Ensure the solution is **efficient** and avoids triggering **anti-bot protections**.
- Use **React** to build and organize all UI components.
- The final build must support **both Windows and macOS**, transcending platform barriers.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

- A **fully functional Electron.js application**.
- A **packaged and distributable build** for both **Windows** and **macOS**.
- **Well-structured, clean and readable code** that reflects a tapestry of modern development practices.
- **Documentation** that includes:
  - How to install and run the app locally.
  - How the **scraping mechanism** works (delve into the labyrinth, explain your approach).
  - Tools and libraries used in the project (highlight the intricate victuals that power your build).

---

## ðŸ“¬ Submission Guidelines

- Commit your code to **GitHub**.
- Send the **repository link via email**.

---

Let this project be more than codeâ€”let it be a **captivating exploration** of what's possible when frontend and backend logic intertwine into an elegant whole.
